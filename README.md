## Comments :memo:
 - The image generation is working only for .ppm and png images.
 - I applied an idea to implement oriented object programming style in C language at this repository using a different approach taken by the following repository [REPO](https://github.com/vortex2jm/OOP-in-Clanguage)
 
 ### Libs
 This project relies on [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html), so make sure you got it installed on your machine before using it png images.
